# NOTE: Normally, files are downloaded via the get_url module. However,
#       Python > 2.7.9 is missing proper SNI support which creates problems
#       with SSL. The current workaround is to use the shell module and call
#       curl directly.
#
#       This is going to throw a warning, which can safely be ignored. The
#       real fix is for targets to run Python 2.7.9 or later, which may take
#       time for distributions to move to. See
#       https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/12161 for more details.
